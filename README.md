# SpringJPA_Sequrity
Project Overview: Spring Boot with Spring Data JPA & Spring Security
This project leverages Spring Boot to create a secure and efficient web application that manages user data with a focus on robust data handling and security.

Key Features:

1.Spring Data JPA Integration: Simplifies database operations through JPA repositories, enabling easy CRUD functionality.

2. It Include aloll  JPA operation like - Query creation using @Query , NativeQuery, JPA Method inbuilt, JPAMethod Query .

3.Spring Security Implementation: Provides user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to application resources.

4.Role-Based Access Control: Implements granular permissions for different user roles (e.g., admin, user) for enhanced security.

5.ESTful API Development: Creates a RESTful API for seamless communication between the client and server.

6.MySQL Database for Development: Utilizes  with the flexibility to switch to production databases.


7. Spring Boot Profiling: Utilizes profile-specific configurations to manage different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) seamlessly.

8. Advanced Logging: Implements structured logging using frameworks like SLF4J and Logback for better traceability and debugging.
 
9. Spring Boot Actuators: Exposes production-ready features such as health checks, metrics, and environment information, enabling efficient application monitoring.

10. Custom Actuator Endpoints: Provides custom endpoints to expose specific application metrics and health indicators tailored to business needs.
11. Configurable Log Levels: Allows dynamic adjustment of logging levels for different components through application properties.
This project demonstrates how to effectively manage application configurations and monitor performance using Spring Bootâ€™s powerful features.
